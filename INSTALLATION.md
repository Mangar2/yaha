# Installation

This file describes how to install yaha on a linux system

## Headless installation of a raspberry pi (Optional)

Yaha runs on any modern os supporting node.js like linux, windows or mac. A raspberry pi is a good choice to run it - I tested it on a Rasberry Pi 3, zero and zero 2. This chapter descripes how to set up a headless raspberry pi (whithout attaching mouse, keyboard or screen). 

This chapter describes a headless installation of the operating system.

### Install a headless raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager

This chapter describes how to install raspberry pi lite - without graphical user interface. We will use the system in headless mode only via. command line using ssh later. This is sufficient for yaha home automation. 

- 
- The raspberry Pi Imager can be found on raspberrypi.com - download and install it for your operation system.
- Run the Pi Imager and choose Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-Bit) for installation (press the write button)
- DO NOT format the disk (when Windows is asking you to do so)

### Activate OpenSSH

Create an empty file called "ssh" in the boot partition. The file will be deleted automatically on startup.

### Install WLAN

Create a file named wpa_supplicant.conf on the same boot partition with the following content (replace the WLAN SSID and the WLAN PASSWORD with your WLAN SSID/Password)

```Script
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
     ssid="WLAN SSID"
     scan_ssid=1
     psk="WLAN PASSWORT"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
Replace WLAN SSID and WLAN PASSWORD with your configuration. If you use VSCode choose "LF" (click on the CRLF in the footer line to change the line end to Linux format)

### Boot the system

Remove the sd card, insert it in your raspberry and switch power on - and wait a minute for the system to boot. 

### Use ssh to log into the raspberry pi

```Script
ssh -l pi pi@raspberrypi
```

Note the raspberry default passwort ist raspberry

If you get an error message WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED, then you might have just installed a second raspberry and the windows system is now complaining, that new new raspberry has different keys. Then delete the raspberry entry from the file C:\\Users\\Mangar/.ssh/known_hosts and try again!

Note: files can be copied with scp (secure copy based on ssh). Example (copies a full directory recursively to a target):

```script
scp -r ./* pi@raspberrypi:/home/pi/yaha/services/*
```

### Change password

Once logged on, change your password with

```Script
sudo passwd pi
```

### update the os

upate the os from time to time use apt full-upgrade to upgrade all packages - do this right after installation

```Script
sudo apt update # download updates for the new version
sudo apt full-upgrade # Riski version to perform the update, removing installed packages if needed
```

If the system is running for a while you might choose to do a more safe version of the upgrade only:

```Script
sudo apt update # download updates for the new version
sudo apt upgrade # Safe version to perform the update, not removing installed packages if needed
```

### Change the raspberries configuration - hostname, timezone, ... (optional)

Run raspi-config to change the raspberryÂ´s configuration

```Script
sudo raspi-config
```

- Change the Hostname (in Menu 1. System Options) - recommended
- Change the timezone (5. Localisation Options)

### Set a static IP-Address (optional)

The default configuration uses dhcp. If you prefere static ip adresses, you might choose to configure a static ip-address

```Script
hostname -I #prints the current IP-address
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf #To edit the configuration file
```
Remove the comment from the ip-address entries and change the addresses accordingly.

## Install needed software on your system (mandatory)

Yaha requires the following software to be installed on your system

- npm
- node 
- pm2 (a multi-node.js tasks manager)
- apache web-server (or equivalent)

### Install npm, node on linux

- 1. Update all packages
- 2. Install node and npm by apt-get 
- 3. Install "n" the node installation utility
- 4. Install an actualized version of node (use 14.18.2, as openzwave-shared does not yet support node v. 16 or higher)

```Script
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 14.18.2
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Alternative manual installation for npm/node

Check the version you need by calling uname and checking online which version is actual. "uname" retrieves the processor architecture (example armV61 raspberry zero W and armV71 for raspberry 3B).

```Script
uname -m
```

Replace the link below with the most actual link and directory name for your ARM version. Hint: the latest armv61 version is https://nodejs.org/dist/v11.15.0/node-v11.15.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz

```Script
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.14.0/node-v15.14.0-linux-armv7l.tar.xz
tar -xf node-v15.14.0-linux-armv7l.tar.xz
cd node-v15.14.0-linux-armv7l
sudo cp -R * /usr/local/

#test
node -v
npm -v
```

### Install remaining tools

- node-gyp is needed to install native node packages
- pm2 is a manager for node tasks we use it in yaha - it is helpful, but not required. 
- Apache is a web-server required to provide a web-frontend
- Git is a source code management software - not required but helpful, if you like to code yourself
- apt autoremove deletes no longer used packages

```Script
sudo npm install -g node-gyp
sudo npm install -g pm2
sudo pm2 startup
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Create the USB symlinks

Several services needs usb devices - a connection to an arduino or a zwave usb stick. The USB device must be addressed by an non changing device name. Linux supports this by symlinks defined in a configuration file.

First attach the usb devices and then find out the Vendor id:

- **lsusb** lists the usb devices
- **usb-devices** lists details of the usb devices

Once you found the right vendor id of your usb stick set it to the configuration file:

```script
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules
```

The following is an example - my installation

```file
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", SYMLINK+="rs485"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", SYMLINK+="arduino"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0658", SYMLINK+="zwave"
```

Now apply the changes by 

```Script
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

You should now see the configured devices in the list of available devices

```Script
ls /dev/* # check the available serial devices. 
```

## Install yaha

### create directory structure

```Script
mkdir yaha
cd yaha
mkdir data # to store state files of services
```

### installing open zwave (optional)

Optional installation. Install open zwave only, if you have zwave devices (and a zwave USB stick or similar). 

```Script
cd \home\pi\yaha
wget http://old.openzwave.com/downloads/openzwave-1.6.1914.tar.gz
tar -xvzf openzwave-1.6.1914.tar.gz
cd openzwave-1.6.1914
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ..
rm openzwave-1.6.1914.tar.gz
```

### install the packages

```Script
cd \home\pi\yaha
npm i @mangar2/brokercli
npm i @mangar2/servicecli
npm i @mangar2/serialdevice
npm i @mangar2/rs485interface
npm i @mangar2/automation
npm i @mangar2/pushover
npm i @mangar2/opensensemap
npm i @mangar2/sunnyportal
npm i @mangar2/messagestore
npm i @mangar2/remoteservice
npm i @mangar2/zwave # only, if you use zwave - and installed openzwave before
```

### create the configuration files

Each service needs a configuraiton file. To start all services, the following configuration files are required

- broker_config.json
- message_store_config.json
- external_config.json
- services_config.json

#### Configuration file for the broker

Create a file with the following content (there are more configuration options. Check the readme of the broker packages for more options):

```script
nano broker_config.json
```

```JSON
{
    "production": {
        "broker": {
            "port": 8183,
            "connections": {
                "directory": "/home/pi/yaha/data"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **port** is the port used for the broker
- **directory** is the directory to save established connections data files

#### Service configuration file structure

All services needs a configuration file. The structure of the configuration file is identical. 

```JSON
{    
    "environment": {
        "runservices": {
            "listener": 8200,
            "clientId": "yaha/messagestore",
            "clean": false,
            "services": [
                "service1", "service2", "service3"
            ]
        },
        "service1": {
        },
        "service2": {
        },
        "service3": {
        }
    }
}
```


- **environment** this is the environment name. The configuration file supports different environments for development, test, production, ... Select the environment by providing the command line parameter --ENV production when starting the script
- **listener** this is the port the service listens to 
- **clientId** this is the name of the service
- **clean** true, if the broker shall delete all information of this services on disconnect
- **services** list of services to enable. 
- **service1, 2, 3, ... n** service specific configuration.


#### Configuration file for the message store

The message store remembers all the messages and is thus the key data source for yahaGUI. 

```script
nano message_store_config.json
```

```JSON
{    
    "production": {
        "runservices": {
            "listener": 8200,
            "clientId": "yaha/messagestore",
            "clean": false,
            "services": [
                "messageStore"
            ]
        },
        "messageStore": {
            "persist" : {
                "directory": "/home/pi/yaha/data"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **directory** directory to persist the currently stored messages

#### configuration for external services

External services are services with internet connection. For security reasons, they are separated from the internal services. 

#### configuration for internal services

Internal services are all services to steer the internal devices (automation, connection to arduino, connection to ESP8266, zwave, ...). Please check the service documentation for the available configuration options

```script
nano services_config.json
```

```JSON
{
    "production": {
        "runservices": {
            "listener": 8202,
            "clientId": "yaha/services",
            "clean": false,
            "services": [
                "automation"
            ]
        },
        "automation": {
            "longitude": 3.14,
            "latitude": 1.414,
            "rules": [
                "/home/pi/yaha/services/motionrules.json",
                "/home/pi/yaha/services/automationrules.json",
                "/home/pi/yaha/services/alertrules.json"
            ],
            "intervalInSeconds": 60
        },
        "zwave": {
        },
        "rs485Interface": {
        },
        "serialDevice": {
        }
    }
}
```


### run the services

The services will be started with pm2 - a runtime manager to control different node packages. It is possible to run all parts of yaha in just one node task, but you are more flexible if you have several services

We will start 4 service packages that you can control by their configuration files

1. the "mqtt-style" broker
2. the message history store
3. Services running intern
4. Services running extern (connecting to remote services)
5. Save the new cofiguration

please not the blank between the first -- and the configuration file path. This blank is important. It tells pm2 to use the following parameters for node and not for pm2

```Script
pm2 start /home/pi/node_modules/@mangar2/brokercli/brokercli.js --name broker --max-memory-restart 100M -- /home/pi/yaha/broker_config.json --env production

pm2 start /home/pi/node_modules/@mangar2/servicecli/servicecli.js --name messages --max-memory-restart 200M -- /home/pi/yaha/message_store_config.json --env production

pm2 start /home/pi/node_modules/@mangar2/servicecli/servicecli.js --name external --max-memory-restart 100M -- /home/pi/yaha/external_config.json --env production

pm2 start /home/pi/node_modules/@mangar2/servicecli/servicecli.js --name internal --max-memory-restart 100M -- /home/pi/yaha/services_config.json --env production

pm2 save
```

### test restarting pm 

```script
pm2 kill
pm2 resurrect
```

### install yahagui

The yahagui package is not yet released, but working in an alpha state. The root directory to place web pages in in /var/www. Install yahagui here.

```Script
cd /var/www/html
mkdir yaha
cd yaha
```

#### Stop apache web-server

```Script
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
```

#### Start apache web server

```Script
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
```

#### Restart apache web server

```Script
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```


## Update the yaha installation

From time to time, you should update your installation to up-to-date versions. But please be careful updating node, as it requires recompiling the native node packages - especially serial and openzwave_shared. Both might not be compatible with the new node version. Thus I recommend to bakcup the services folder before any update.

### Update the operating system

```Script
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### update node/npm 

Only update, if the newer version fits together with the node version. The best version for raspberry zero (armV61 architecture) is 6.7.0.

```Script
sudo n [version] # sudo npm install -g npm@6.7.0 - for armV61
```

### update yaha

```Script
cd /home/pi/yaha
npm update
```

## How toÂ´s (for developers only)

The following chapter provides information how to solve problems - mainly when developing services. 

### install code (optional)

If you like to develop for yaha, you might download the code from github

```script
mkdir source
cd source
git clone https://github.com/Mangar2/yaha
# get new version
git pull
```

### Remote debugging

To remotely debug a node.js process running on a headless raspi

1: start the node task with --inspect

```Script
node --inspect /home/pi/yaha/services/node_modules/@mangar2/servicecli/servicecli.js /home/pi/yaha/services/arduino_config.json --env production
```

Copying the link should not be needed, chrome will automatically identify the available inspect link. If not, copy the link from the node response (example:)
ws://127.0.0.1:9229/ce7a4dd6-84cf-48d0-a5c2-b5859abfe335

Create a ssh tunnel (on the computer with the debugging interface):
ssh -L 9221:localhost:9229 pi@rapberrypi

In Chrome enter: 
chrome://inspect

### Mount an usb drive (for example a backup device)

First check the available disks

```Script
sudo fdisk -l
sudo fsck /dev/sda1 # to check the file system
```

If it is an exFAT disk, install the exFAT support


```Script
sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse
sudo apt-get install exfat-utils
```

Second Create a mount point and mount the device

```Script
sudo mkdir /mnt/backup 
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/backup
```

Or edit /etc/fstab to permanently mount the device

```Script
sudo blkid # to ind the PARTUUID you need for fstab
sudo nano /etc/fstab
# entry example:
# PARTUUID=64fbae2f-01  /mnt/backup     exfat   defaults,umask=000 0      0
```

### Install samba (file sharing)

To mount drives on the raspberry pi install samba

```Script
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin
```

Then configure the samba config file

```Script
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Create the password for samba

```Script
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
```
