# JSON schema validator

This is a JSON schema validator for version 0.7 schemata. It supports most but not all features of the version 0.7 schema
Many thanks to epoberezkin/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite for providing a cool test suite.

## Not supported

* remote-refs (neither local nor remote)
* unicode-code-points (EmacsScript length is used to get the lengt of  a string)
* propertyNames

## Result messages

The validator produces an output explaining why a schema did not validate. The output is a Object showing every failure and the path to the invalid data
