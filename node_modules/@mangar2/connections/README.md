# Abstract

This package is part of an MQTT style broker. It manages connections to the broker. It can be used idependently - if you create another MQTT style broker (I see no other usage).

## Functionality

* filename: name of the file to persist connections (a timestamp will be added to the filename)
* directory: directory to persist connections
* inFlightWindow: amount of pending messages per topic for ordered topics. Default: 1
* timeoutInMilliseconds: timeout to retransmit messages
* maxRetryCount: amount of retries of a single message until the connection if closed

The main functions are

* connect: establish a new connection
  * clientId: name of the client
  * host: host name/ip
  * port: port number
  * clean: true, if the connection is fully deleted on disconnect. Else subscriptions and messages will be stored
* disconnect: removes a connection
* subscribe: subscribes for a topic
