# Abstract

errorlog is a small helper to log error messages (usually used in catch blocks)

## Functionality

(error) => logs the error to the console with console.error
If error is a string, it just logs the string.
If error is an Error object it logs the message and the stack trace.
I use it on catch blocks that I do not expect to fail
An error output usually looks like:
2019-9-28 17:45:22 error message
