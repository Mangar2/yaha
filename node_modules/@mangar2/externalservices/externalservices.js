 * @overview
 * Yaha microservice supporting external connections
 * @description
 * You need to provide a configuration file called "yahaconfig.json" stored in the root directory.
 * You need to provide the configuration for all used modules services and for the mqttclient
 * (see mqttclient, opensensemap, pushover, sunnyportal modules). Modules to run:
 * - opensensemap - send data to the opensensemap
 * - pushover - send data to the pushover app
 * - sunnyportal - reads data from sunnyportal
 * @example
 * npm run
 */
