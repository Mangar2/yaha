# Abstract

This is a very simple http web client. It is based on the http packet included in node.js.
I built it due to its simplicity and the independence from other packages

## Functionality

The class provides a simple interface to publish data to clients.

### Usage example

* Create a lient with host and port
  let client = new HttpClient("127.0.0.1", 9001);
* Register a callback to get the result
  client.on("result", result => console.log(result))
* Send a GET to 127.0.0.1:9001/clients with the body test
  client.send("/clients", "GET", "test", {'Content-Type': 'application/json', packetId: 1, mqttpacket: "publish"} );

### supported callbacks

* result(statusCode, headers, payload)
* error(err) or any error

### close

The static close method closes all open connections for all pending requests
