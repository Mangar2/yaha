## Class Retry

`new Retry()`

Class providing a retry facility calling a callback "count" times asyncronously with a delay inbetween Additionally providing a "topic" based retry ( "topicRetry" ) with the following functionality : a . Asynchronously calles a global callback "count" times with a delay inbetween b . If no global callback is provided , it calls a callback prior registrated to the topic c . If topicRetry is called with a still running existing retry loop for the same topic , this existing is terminated .

### Example

```javascript
const retry = new Retry()
// prints 5 times hello world, with a delay of 1 second between each output
retry.retry(5, 1000, () => console.log("hello world"))
// prints hello1, world, hello2, world, hello2
retry.topicRetry('hello', 2, 1000, () => console.log("hello1"))
retry.topicRetry('world', 2, 1000, () => console.log("world"))
retry.topicRetry('hello', 2, 1000, () => console.log("hello2"))
```

### Retry Methods

#### on

`on (topic, callback)`

Registers a callback for a topic

##### on Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `topic` | `string` | topic to register a callback | |
| `callback` | `function(` | called on matching topic on retries | |

##### on throws

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `Error` | if the callback is not 'function' |

#### retry

`async retry (count, delayInMilliseconds, callback) => {Promise}`

Calls a callback function multiple times and waits between the calls .

##### retry Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `count` | `number` | quantity of retries | |
| `delayInMilliseconds` | `number` | amount of milliseconds to wait between retries | |
| `callback` | `function(loopNumber` | function called on each retry | |

##### retry returns

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `Promise` | promise resolving , when all callbacks are done |

#### topicRetry

`async topicRetry (topic, count, delayInMilliseconds, callback) => {Promise}`

Calls a callback function multiple times and waits between the calls . If you call "retry" with the same topic a second time , it will stop the running retry loop with the same topic

##### topicRetry Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `topic` | `string` | name of the topic to retry | |
| `count` | `number` | quantity of retries | |
| `delayInMilliseconds` | `number` | amount of milliseconds to wait between retries | |
| `callback` | `function(` | function called on each retry | |

##### topicRetry returns

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `Promise` | promise resolving , when all callbacks are done |
