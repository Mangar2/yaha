# Abstract

Main program , service to store messages and provide a rest api to access to stored messages an the message hierarchy This service is implemented by connecting the mqttclient and the messagestore to a new service

Runs any yaha service as an mqttclient . Services needs to bring the following interface :

- A "prepare ( config , [ serviceObject = null ] ) " function - returning a service object and initializes it
- A getSubscriptions method to get a list of topics to subscribe { topic : QoS , topic : QoS , . . . }
- A handle message method to handle a mqtt message sent to the service
- Optional - a on ( 'publish' , callback ) method to register a publish message callback
- Optional - a close ( ) function to be called to close/stop the service´s background tasks
