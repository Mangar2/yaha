/**
 * Class providing a facility to retry a callback "count" times asynchronously with a delay in between.
 * Additionally, it provides a "topic" based retry ("topicRetry") with the following functionalities:
 * - Asynchronously calls a global callback "count" times with a delay in between.
 * - If no global callback is provided, it calls a callback registered to the topic.
 * - If topicRetry is called with an already running retry loop for the same topic, the existing one is terminated.
 * 
 * @param {boolean} immediateFirstCall - true, if the first call should happen immediately, default is true.
 * @example
 * const retry = new Retry()
 * // prints "hello world" 5 times, with a delay of 1 second between each output
 * retry.retry(5, 1000, () => console.log("hello world"))
 * // prints hello1, world, hello2, world, hello2
 * retry.topicRetry('hello', 2, 1000, () => console.log("hello1"))
 * retry.topicRetry('world', 2, 1000, () => console.log("world"))
