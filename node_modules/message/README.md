##Abstract
The yaha home automation is based on messages. Nothing happens without a message. The message runs from creator to broker and then to 
the receiver. On every step, a reason will added including a timestamp to get a full trace. As an example for a light switched on 
at sunrise we get something like (simplified):
* switched on due to time > sunrise<
* received by broker
* send to arduino
* acknowledged by arduino
* acknowledge received by broker

###Functionality
The message has the following components:
* topic (the MQTT like topic string /one/two/tree...)
* value the new value of anything (like a device or a sensor)
* reason an array of trace log entries
* QoS quality of service to send the message. The Quality of service in defined in the MQTT protocol
(QoS levels 0: fire and forget; 1: send and wait for an acknowledge; 2: kind of two face commit)
