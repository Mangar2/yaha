<h2>Abstract</h2>
The home automation needs a way to persist data. Keeping DBMS systems up to date is too much work. So I decided to implement
a "trival" persistance: Holing all relevant data of a microservice in memory and dump the memory to disk - from time to time.
This is supported by this module.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
This class supports simple persistence of data (not transaciton safe). To get around the need of any type of database it just 
stores one JSON structure in a file and keep some older files of older data. If the acutal file is corrupted, the class will
read the last valid version. 

The following methods require a "filenameBasis" parameter. This is the starting string of the filename. The class will automatically
add a timestamp to be able to save multiple file version. 
A file with the "filenameBasis" "motion" will look like: motion2019-07-29T220009.827.json

CAUTION: the Class automatically deletes old file and thus all files of the format  "[filenameBasis]2019-07-29T"

Major methods:
/**
 * Stringifies a JSON and writes it to a file. 
 * It will automatically add a timestamp to the provided "base" filename
 * It does not throws errors, but logs write errors to the console
 * @param {string} directory directory to delete file
 * @param {string} filenameBasis basis filename of the file. The 
 * @param {object} objectToSafe object to save as JSON
 * @param {function} callback function(filepath) called, when file is written
 * @returns undefined
 */
saveObjectToFile(directory, filenameBasis, objectToSave)

/**
 * Reads data from a file
 * @param {string} directory directory to delete file
 * @param {string} filenameBasis basis filename of the file. The 
 * @returns {object} the object read.
 */
readData(directory, filenameBasis)
