# Abstract

MQTT works with topics. Topics have a similar structure like a file directory /one/two/three ...
It supports a topic pattern with wildchards "+" matching any string (like "one", "two"...) and # matching anything that follows

This node.js module can store a list of topics and can find all, any or the best pattern matches your topic. The best?? Yes, any pattern has a "value" and it can select the best value. Either use the build in ">" operator or provide your own compare function.

MQTT defines QoS (quality of service) for messages. I use the "best" topic to find out, if there is another topic with a higher need of quality of service

See the test.js file to see examples that matches and that do not maches.
